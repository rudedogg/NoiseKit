# ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸš§
## ON HOLD UNTIL WWDC 2020
**To include the metal shaders in a Swift Package, we need https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0271-package-manager-resources.md.** 
Once Swift 5.3 is released I'll start working on this again. It is close to being usable as a Swift package.
**This project is a work-in-progress. I plan to make destructive changes to the git history up until a 1.0 release, so relying on this code before that time is not advised!**

## Installation

Add this to your project using Swift Package Manager. In Xcode that is simply: File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency... and you're done.

## Author

This project is a fork of the [AHNoise project](https://github.com/AndyHeardApps/AHNoise) by [Andy Heard](https://github.com/AndyHeardApps). Andy was nice enough to let me use the code as I see fit to keep the project going. The amazing shader code to generate the noise, etc. was all done by him.
