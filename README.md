# 🚧 Under construction 🚧
**This project is a work-in-progress. I plan to make destructive changes to the git history up until a 1.0 release, so relying on this code before that time is not advised!**

## Author

This project is a fork of the [AHNoise project](https://github.com/AndyHeardApps/AHNoise) by [Andy Heard](https://github.com/AndyHeardApps). Andy was nice enough to let me use the code as I see fit to keep the project going. The amazing shader code to generate the noise, etc. was all done by him.
